                    <p>It was was a transformative experience that marked the 
                        beginning of my professional journey in software development. 
                        In this role, I worked as part of a collaborative team, 
                        contributing to the design, development, and deployment of web-based applications.</p>

                        <p>This position allowed me to refine my skills in 
                        [insert technologies/tools you worked with, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,
                         Django, etc.] and gain hands-on experience in the full software development lifecycle.
                         This role not only helped me grow technically but also instilled in me the importance of teamwork, 
                         problem-solving, and continuous learning. It laid a solid foundation for my career as a developer.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>has been a journey of continuous growth, learning, and innovation. Over time, I have honed my skills in 
                        various technologies, from front-end frameworks like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end technologies 
                        like Python, Django, and MySQL. Each project I’ve worked on has offered unique challenges, whether it 
                        involved building responsive user interfaces, creating efficient APIs, or integrating complex databases.</p>
                    <p>What stands out most about this journey is the collaborative nature of development. 
                        Working in teams has taught me the value of clear communication, version control systems like Git, 
                        and agile methodologies. Beyond the technical aspects, I’ve learned the importance of understanding user needs,
                         which drives the creation of solutions that are not only functional but also impactful.</p>

                    <h5>What I Know</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the course of my learning and experience, I have developed a strong foundation in both front-end and 
                        back-end development. On the front-end, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I can create 
                        responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. My experience also extends to using frameworks like 
                        Bootstrap to enhance the design and functionality of web pages.</p>
                    <p>On the back-end, I have a solid understanding of Python and have worked extensively with Django to build 
                        scalable and secure web applications. I am skilled in database management using MySQL, where I can design 
                        schemas, write complex queries, and perform CRUD operations. I also have experience in using Node.js and 
                        Express for API development and integrating the back-end with the front-end.</p>
